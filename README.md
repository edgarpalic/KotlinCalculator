# KotlinCalculator
All programmers have to make a calculator at some point apparently. Initially made while learning kotlin and then updated many months later with the latest kotlin & android studio updates.

### Latest Updates
* Use of bindings to access layout components.
* A newer design. 
* Big buttons for weak eyes.
* Light and Dark mode for coder eyes.

### Problems
* When switching from (Light to Dark || Dark to Light) mode the values were saved but not showing on the screen. Instead of figuring it out I just cleared the values so a fresh calculation can be made.

### Result
